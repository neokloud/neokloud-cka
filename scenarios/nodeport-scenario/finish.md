# 🎉 Congratulations!

You’ve successfully completed the **NodePort Service Practice** lab!

In this scenario, you:
1. Deployed a backend NGINX deployment.
2. Exposed it using a NodePort Service.
3. Deployed a frontend curl client to test connectivity.
4. Verified access internally and via NodePort.

Great job exploring how Kubernetes exposes applications through NodePort services.
