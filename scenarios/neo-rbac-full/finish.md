# Scenario Complete

You have successfully resolved the RBAC error generated by the Deployment `neo-depl` in the `neo` namespace.  
The Pod can now list Deployments without permission issues, and the logs show clean, expected output.

---

## What You Achieved

- Created namespace and directory structure  
- Applied a broken Deployment producing RBAC errors  
- Identified and understood the exact RBAC issue from Pod logs  
- Created a Role with minimal required permissions  
- Created a RoleBinding connecting the Role to the correct ServiceAccount  
- Restarted the Deployment to refresh Pod permissions  
- Verified correct functionality through logs

This completes the CKAD mock scenario.  
You can now proceed to the next challenge.
