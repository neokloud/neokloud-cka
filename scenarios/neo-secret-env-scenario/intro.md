# Neo: Secret to Environment Variable (neo-lab)

In this lab you'll create a Kubernetes Secret and consume its data as environment variables inside a Pod.
The lab is split into three steps. Each step includes copyable commands and embedded YAML where appropriate.

Namespace used: `neo-lab`
Secret name: `neo-db-secret`
Pod name: `neo-env-pod`

Follow the steps in order. Do **not** skip steps.
